We are a computational chemistry group specializing in molecular simulations of energy materials. We are affiliated with the [AI4EC Lab](https://ai4ec.ac.cn/) at [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/main.htm) in Xiamen, China.

Our research focuses on the **development and application of advanced computational chemistry methods**, including Molecular Dynamics, first-principles calculations, and machine-learning approaches. We investigate the structure, dynamics, and properties of complex materials, with a particular interest on designing and optimizing innovative **materials for energy storage and conversion applications**, such as supercapacitors and batteries.

[**Research interests**](/research/):
- Interfacial structure and dynamics
- Ion transport and diffusion
- Porous electrode materials
- Condensed electrolytes
- Machine learning for materials discovery

We are always looking for talented and motivated students to join our group. If you are interested in pursuing a PhD or Master's degree in computational chemistry, please feel free to [contact Dr. Sheng Bi](mailto:sheng.bi@xmu.edu.cn).
