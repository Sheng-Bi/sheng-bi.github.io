We are always looking for talented and motivated people to join our group. Below are the current opportunities available:

### PhD and Master's Openings
- **PhD Openings**: We have **one PhD position** available each year.  
- **Master's Openings**: We have **two to three Master's positions** available each year.


**Notes for PhD and Master's applicants**
1. For Master's applicants, we welcome students from various backgrounds. A keen interest in computational chemistry and a willingness to learn are essential.
2. For PhD applicants, we prefer candidates with a strong background in physics, chemistry, materials science, or related fields. Experience in molecular simulations or machine learning is a plus but not mandatory.
3. Applicants should pass the English proficiency test (CET-6 or equivalent) before enrollment. 
4. Applicants should have a strong interest in programming (Python, C/C++, Fortran, etc.) and data analysis, as these are essential skills in our daily research work.

We offer a competitive stipend and great working environment (Mac desktop, ergonomic chairs, etc.) and various leisure activities (in-door basketball, gym, group outings etc.). The working hours for new-comers are from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and are flexible for high-grade students, and we emphasize **work-life balance**. In return, we expect our students to be **self-motivated, proactive, and collaborative**.

**We welcome students to join our group for their graduation projects or to get an early start with the AI4EC Lab. During this period, the lab will provide a stipend to cover the rent and living expenses.**

**欢迎保研的同学来组内做毕业设计，AI4EC实验室将会在这期间提供生活津贴。**

### Postdoctoral Openings
We currently have **one to two postdoctoral openings**. Preferred candidates should have experience either in:
- Molecular simulations (e.g., Molecular Dynamics, DFT, classical DFT)
- Machine learning (e.g., machine learning force field development, machine-learning analysis methods)

**The renumeration can be negotiable based on applicant's experience (at least 300K CNY/year, Brut salary). The university will provide a housing allowance or a free apartment.**

**博士落户厦门可以有8W的一次性奖励，博士后出站后留厦工作的可再获得30万元安家补贴。**

### Visiting Scholar Opportunities
We welcome overseas PhD students/Postdocs to visit our group for short-term research projects (either proposed by me or by the candidates themselves). The AI4EC Lab will **provide a stipend during the visiting and cover the return flight**. The duration of the visit is flexible, but we recommend at least **3 months**.

### Undergraduate Opportunities
We also welcome **undergraduate students** to join our group for internships or to experience the research environment and group vibe.
