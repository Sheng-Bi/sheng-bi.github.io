               narrowed electrochemical windows due to the involvement of water,
               absorbed on the electrode surface, in electrolysis. In this work,
               we performed molecular dynamics simulations to explore effects of
               adding Li salt in humid ionic liquids on the water adsorbed on
               the electrode surface. Results reveal that most of the water
               molecules are pushed away from both cathode and anode, by adding
               salt. The water remaining on the electrode is almost bound with
               Li+, having significantly lowered activity. The Li+-bonding and
               re-arrangement of the surface-adsorbed water both facilitate the
               inhibition of water electrolysis, and thus prevent the reduction
               of electrochemical windows of humid hydrophobic ionic liquids.
               This finding is testified by cyclic voltammetry measurements
               where salt-in-humid ionic liquids exhibit enlarged
               electrochemical windows. Our work provides the underlying
               mechanism and a simple but practical approach for protection of
               humid ionic liquids from electrochemical performance degradation.",

  abstract  = "Metallic 1T-MoS2 is a promising electrode material for
               supercapacitor applications. Its layered structure allows the
               efficient intercalation of ions, leading to experimental
               volumetric capacitance as high as 140 F/cm3. Molecular dynamics
               could in principle be used to characterize its charging
               mechanism; however, unlike conventional nanoporous carbon,
               1T-MoS2 is a multicomponent electrode. The Mo and S atoms have
               very different electronegativities so that 1T-MoS2 cannot be
               simulated accurately using the conventional constant potential
               method. In this work, we show that controlling the
               electrochemical potential of the atoms allows one to recover
               average partial charges for the elements in agreement with
               electronic structure calculations for the material at rest,
               without compromising the ability to simulate systems under an
               applied voltage. The simulations yield volumetric capacitances in
               agreement with experiments. We show that due to the large
               electronegativity of S, the co-ion desorption is the main
               charging mechanism at play during the charging process. This
               contrasts drastically with carbon materials for which ion
               exchange and counterion adsorption usually dominate. In the
               future, our method can be extended to the study of a wide range
               of families of 2D layered materials such as MXenes.",
